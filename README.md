# Did Fandango Stop Inflating Movie Ratings?

In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a [popular article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where he presented strong evidence which suggests that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, I analyze more recent movie ratings data to and compare it to the 2015 data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. 

The notebook is based on a guided project from Dataquest, an online Data Science bootcamp. The learning goal of the project was to test statistical sampling, variables, scales of measurement, and frequency distributions.
